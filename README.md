# "Totally not extremely complicated recipes"
This was a joke that went too far. It all started with the cake recpie and is growing into instructions on how to do simple life tasks and now a website.

You can visit the website [here](http://bluekiwi.lol/totally-not-extremely-complicated-recipes/)

The enchanted book is from [here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Enchanted_Book?file=Enchanted_Book.gif)

## TODO:
- Make some more recipes
- Style up the website better
- Get a faveicon
- Add public database entries (make thier own recipes)
- Migrate to CF pages once I know how...

note to self
shift + option + f to remat Google Docs properly
